# Poligap-ember

Welcome! This repository is for the front-end Ember.js application for Poligap.

If you wish to only use the front-end of the application, just clone the repository, `npm install`
and you'll be ready to go. The adapter is already hooked up to the API, which you are free to connect 
to.

###Poligap API

If you would like to have both the API and the front-end application running locally, you'll need to 
clone the Rails repository and follow the directions there to get it up and running. You'll then change 
the IP address located in `app/adapters/application.js` to wherever you are running the API.
